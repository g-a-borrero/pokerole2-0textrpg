# What is PokeRole?
I didn't make it, I just love it. Learn more about it [here](https://www.pokeroleproject.com/).

# So what is this project then?
A pitiful attempt to make the TTRPG (version 2.0) playable as a text RPG adventure using Python. I'm not sure if it'll run on most computers. I know it runs on mine, but mine has a lot of RAM. It could probably stand to be optimized or made in another language.

# Other Notes
I'm really proud of my pseudo-random distribution formula. Use it if you want. I love it. Aaa.
